# Page-Rank-Simulator-

Google using a trademarked algorithm called PageRank, which assigns each Web page a relevancy score.

So, in this program, I will be using a random generator to assign a number as a page score for each of URLs from the users input. Then, the program will sorting the URLs based on the page score by implementing the heap sort. 

The users could change or insert a new page score by implementing the heap function. Also, this program will implement a priority queue to show the top 10 URLs.

# Features

1. The program will display a total page score of each URLs.
The total page score is depend on four factors which are: 
- The frequency and location of keywords within the Web page.
- How long the Web page has existed.
- The number of other Web pages that link to the page in question.
- How much the webpage owner has paid to Google for advertisement purpose. 

2.The users could insert a new URL and a page score.
By implementing:
- Build Max Heap
- Max Heapify
- Max Heap Insert
- Heap Increase Key

3. The program will show the highest page rank based on the highest total page score, by implementing the heap sort.

4. By implementing a priority queue, the program will show the top 10 URLs.
